# AWESUM DICE EXPLODER!!!!!!!

okay, maybe that was a little much...  
  
So, this is a set pf programs i've designed to do some probability & dice exploration in haskell & ruby (and possibly javascript...)  Right now it's in pre-alpha-beta-stage-of-gamma-ray-ness stage, but soon, maybe, it won't be.  Keep tuned for more info!!!
